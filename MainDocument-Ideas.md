# Alternate Realities Game Jam
 Brandon Miller & Lochlan Perry-Scott's Game jam based on the theme of 'Alternate Realities'
 
 Idea Generation:
 
 # Random Rooms
 - You play as an first person perspective that owns a 'room' full of doors, each door leads to an alternate reality that the player must complete a mini game / puzzle to escape.
 - Each room is a randomly generated theme that is differant from the main game jam. I.E. the first room is a mini game but the player has "1HP".
